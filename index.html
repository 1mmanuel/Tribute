            <li>
              <b>1942 - Born Cassius Clay, Jr.:</b>

              Cassius Clay, Jr. is born to Odessa and Cassius Clay, Sr. at the
              Louisville General Hospital in South Louisville. Two years later,
              brother Rudy (later Rahaman Ali) is born, and soon the family
              moves into the Parkland neighborhood.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1954 - Red Bike Moment:</b> The red Schwinn bike of
              twelve-year-old Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay, Jr.) is stolen
              outside the annual Louisville Home Show. Reporting the theft to
              nearby policeman Joe Martin, he expresses a desire to “whup” the
              culprit. Martin—who trains young boxers—suggests he should first
              learn how to fight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1957 - Enters Central High School:</b>

              Ali struggles academically (he was later diagnosed with dyslexia)
              but becomes a school celebrity for his dedication to training,
              including running to school every day alongside the bus. He would
              visit the school as a hero after the Rome Olympic Games and his
              legacy remains a point of Central pride.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1960 - Wins Olympic Gold Medal:</b>

              Three months out of high school, Ali competes at the 1960 Summer
              Olympics in Rome. Despite being afraid of airplanes, Ali boards
              the flight while wearing an army surplus parachute. He wins the
              light-heavyweight gold medal, defeating Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of
              Poland.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1960 - Signs with Louisville Sponsoring Group:</b>
              At age 18, Ali enters a contract with a group of Louisville-area
              businessmen who will finance his professional boxing career. Ali
              is represented by Alberta O. Jones, who influenced his future
              philanthropic efforts. Ali would later donate the winnings of his
              first professional fight to Kosair Children's Hospital.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1964 - Ali Vs. Sonny Liston (I):</b>

              In his first heavyweight title bout, Ali is a longshot to defeat
              Liston, widely seen as unstoppable. Nonetheless, Ali predicts “a
              total eclipse of the Sonny”—and indeed Liston does not rise to the
              seventh round's opening bell. “I'm the greatest! I shook up the
              world!” Win - Technical Knockout in 6 rounds
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1964 - Announces Conversion to Islam, Name Change</b>

              The day after winning his first heavyweight belt, the fighter
              announces he is a proud Muslim. He goes by the name Cassius X for
              nine days, then receives the new name of Muhammad Ali from Nation
              of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1967 - Refuses Military Draft in Houston</b>

              Ali twice refuses to step forward when military induction
              officials call his name, citing his conscientious objection to the
              war in Vietnam as a minister in the non-violent religion of Islam.
              Convicted of draft evasion, he is stripped of his heavyweight
              title and boxing licenses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1970 - Ali Vs. Jerry Quarry: First Post-Exile Fight</b>

              This fight was not approved by Georgia governor Lester Maddox, a
              segregationist who declared a “day of mourning” over it. However,
              only Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell’s approval was necessary, secured
              through the efforts of State Senator Leroy Johnson. Ali previewed
              the fight in a drawing to Leroy Nieman, where Maddox is drawn
              running down the back right aisle, yelling "Stop that fight!" Win
              - Technical Knockout in 3 rounds
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1971 - Ali Vs. Joe Frazier (I)</b>

              In a chance to reclaim his title, Ali's first heavyweight fight
              with Frazier matched two undefeated fighters. However, Ali's three
              years away from the ring made the difference in a grueling 15
              rounds. It is Ali's first defeat and the start of the greatest
              rivalry in boxing history. Loss - Unanimous Decision in 15 rounds
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1971 - Supreme Court Decision:</b>
              In a unanimous decision, the United States Supreme Court overturns
              Ali's conviction for draft evasion, saying the Appeals Court had
              not properly established their grounds against Ali's conscientious
              objector status. His passport is returned, and he is officially a
              free man.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1972 - Makes First Pilgrimage to Mecca - Hajj:</b>

              With his passport returned by the Supreme Court decision, Ali
              travels to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj for the first time. Ali
              observes ihrām—a sacred state of cleansing and attire—as he
              approaches Mecca. While there, Ali also meets with the royal
              family.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1974 - Ali Vs. Joe Frazier (II):</b>

              Although Joe Frazier no longer held the title of Heavyweight
              Champion, Muhammad Ali wanted to face him again to prove he was
              indeed “the Greatest.” Billed as “Super Fight II,” the match went
              the distance of 12 rounds and ultimately led to a unanimous
              decision in favor of Ali. Win - Unanimous Decision in 12 rounds
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1974 - Ali Vs. George Foreman:</b>

              A showdown in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) to
              reclaim Ali's heavyweight title puts him against Foreman, the
              imposing favorite. Ali employs his “rope-a-dope” tactic: leaning
              on the ropes, Ali absorbs body blows until Foreman finally wears
              himself out. The fight held cultural impact for the people of
              Zaire, who connected with Ali, as well as the millions who watched
              the fight around the world. Win - Knockout in 8 rounds
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1975 - Ali Vs. Joe Frazier (III):</b>

              Ali meets Frazier in the final installment of this storied boxing
              rivalry, and one of the most grueling but best displays of the
              sport. It was the fight Ali said was the closest he's ever been to
              dying. Both fighters faded fast toward the end, but it was
              Frazier's corner who conceded in round 14. Win - Technical
              Knockout in 14 rounds
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1978 - Ali Vs. Leon Spinks (II):</b> Ali's self-appointed title
              of “The Greatest” is solidified in a Spinks rematch at The
              Superdome in New Orleans. The event has the then-highest
              attendance ever for an indoor bout. Ali takes the world
              heavyweight championship for a third time—a first in boxing
              history. Win - Unanimous Decision in 15 rounds
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1981 - Ali Vs. Trevor Berbick:</b>

              In the 61st and final fight of his career, Muhammad Ali begins the
              bout trying to look like his former self, but by the sixth round,
              he began to tire. After Berbick was declared winner, Ali
              officially retired. Loss - Unanimous Decision in 10 rounds
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1984 - Diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease:</b>

              Since retiring, Ali's health had intensely deteriorated. After
              checking himself into New York's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital,
              Ali is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a brain disorder that
              leads to shaking, stiffness, difficulty walking, and loss of
              balance and coordination.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1996 - Lights the Summer Olympic Cauldron:</b>

              In an opening ceremony surprise, with undisguised challenges
              holding the torch and yet focused and precise, Ali lights the
              Olympic cauldron in a moment that captivates 3.5 billion worldwide
              viewers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1998 - Named U.N. Messenger of Peace:</b>

              Ali's 1978 address to the Special Committee against Apartheid,
              along with his own belief in sport's power to create unity,
              inspires Secretary-General Kofi Annan to name Ali as one of his
              first messengers of peace.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>2005 - Receives Presidential Medal of Freedom:</b>

              President George W. Bush awards Ali with the highest civilian
              honor in the United States: “Across the world, billions of people
              know Muhammad Ali as a brave, compassionate and charming man, and
              the American people are proud to call Muhammad Ali one of our
              own.”

              <b>2016 - Muhammad Ali Passes Away:</b>

              Muhammad Ali passes away late in the evening in Scottsdale,
